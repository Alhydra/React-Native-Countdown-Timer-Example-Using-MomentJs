My name is Youssef el habchi, from [React Native Master](https://rn-master.com) I welcome each and everyone of you.

Today we will go on another Journey to make a react native countdown timer example using momentJs.

And as usual I will try to make it a bit good looking. So stay with e for a while and letâ€™s get started.
Feel free to read the whole article on my blog [React native Countdown Timer Using Momentjs ](https://rn-master.com/react-native-countdown-timer-example-using-momentjs/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an [Expo.io Project](https://expo.io/@alhydra/react-native-countdown-timer-example-using-momentjs)
